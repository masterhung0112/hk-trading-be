- [ ] [Generate data in any way](#data-controller)
    - [ ] Data is the array of element
    - [ ] Data is generated and updated in realtime
    - [ ] Data is generated by script
- [ ] Update the data that have the change
- [ ] How chart pane know what to display, what to config

# Data Source

The Data Source contains the data that can be added/removed/updated in its data pool,
then notify there's change in the source.
Any data listener can re-generate the new data.

## The list of data source
- The OHLC data source
- The working OHLC data source (the combination of OHLC data source and scale min/max)
- The indicator data source
    - This listen to the `The working OHLC data source`

# Data Controller

Each dataset must have a dataset controller.

The purpose of dataset controller is:
- Convert the array of the raw data to the array of drawable data
- Keep track the changed raw data and update the correpsonding drawable data
- Drawable data (x, y, width, height...) need to consider the scale
- Response to the changes in option of dataset

From the drawable data generated by dataset controller,
renderer will draw the drawable data to the canvas

- [ ] Map the drawable data to each data element in dataset
- [ ] Listen to the added/updated/removed data of dataset
- [ ] Listen to the changes of scale, then update the drawable data

## Keep Display Object
Data can be greater than the display object.
Because it's expensive to create display object
I want to reuse the display object for the data that is in scale range.

# Indicator Data Generator

Indicator will receive the ohlc data, then generate the data on the fly.
