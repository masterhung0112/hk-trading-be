# Overview

Each dataset must have a dataset controller.

The purpose of dataset controller is:
- Convert the array of the raw data to the array of drawable data
- Keep track the changed raw data and update the correpsonding drawable data
- Drawable data (x, y, width, height...) need to consider the scale
- Response to the changes in option of dataset

From the drawable data generated by dataset controller,
renderer will draw the drawable data to the canvas

- [ ] Map the drawable data to each data element in dataset
- [ ] Listen to the added/updated/removed data of dataset
- [ ] Listen to the changes of scale, then update the drawable data

# Keep Display Object
Data can be greater than the display object.
Because it's expensive to create display object
I want to reuse the display object for the data that is in scale range.
