# Overview

Each dataset must have a dataset controller.

The purpose of dataset controller is:
- Convert the raw data to the drawable data
- Drawable data (x, y, width, height...) need to consider the scale
- Response to the changes in option of dataset

From the drawable data generated by dataset controller,
renderer will draw the drawable data to the canvas

- [ ] Map the drawable data to each data element in dataset
- [ ] Listen to the added/updated/removed data of dataset
- [ ] Listen to the changes of scale, then update the drawable data
